Introduction

Hi there! My name is Tennie White, and this repository contains my work for CS330: Programming Language Project (PLP) Assignment 2. 
In this project, I explore PHP's data types, naming conventions, and type conversions through hands-on coding examples. 
This README will provide an overview of my approach, the questions I aimed to answer, and how you can run the code yourself.

About This Project

Understanding how different data types are handled in PHP is critical for effective programming. This project dives into:

PHP's variable naming rules and conventions

The language's dynamic and weak typing characteristics

Implicit and explicit type conversions

Practical examples of data type operations

The accompanying php_data_types.php file contains all the PHP scripts demonstrating these concepts.

Key Questions Explored

What are the naming requirements for variables in PHP?

Is PHP statically or dynamically typed?

Is PHP strongly or weakly typed?

What happens when adding a string and an integer in PHP?

What are PHP's limitations with data types and conversions?

What built-in complex data types does PHP provide?

Each question is answered with explanations and working PHP code examples.

Running the Code

To run the examples on your local machine:

Ensure you have PHP installed. You can check by running:

php -v

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/php-plp-assignment.git
cd php-plp-assignment

Run the PHP script:

php php_data_types.php

This will execute the script and print output to the terminal.

Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper appreciation for PHP's flexibility with data types and its implicit type conversions.
While PHPâ€™s weak typing can be convenient, it can also introduce unexpected behavior. Using explicit type casting and enforcing strict types where necessary can lead to more predictable code.
